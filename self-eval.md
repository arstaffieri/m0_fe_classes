# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?
I can feel my brain stretching. Learning is serious hard work and I was exhausted at the end of the day. It was so rewarding to fix my errors and write working code. The satisfaction of having everything work was just... *chef's kiss*.
- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?
My workflow is going better than it was at the beginning of the week. I am taking breaks and I am making sure I'm taking lunch. I realized today that my mind was wandering and I forced myself to take a break so I could come back fresh.
- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?
I'm going to need to remember to take breaks on time, to go to bed and get up at the same time every day, to remove all choice from breakfast/lunch/dinner and make sure everything is planned and easily accessable without thought. I'm likely going to be too tired to cook after days at Turing.
